## Reference Files for kaggle, hackerrank drills, and realpython.com lessons

This repo organizes code and notes from kaggle courses and competitions, serving mainly as a general reference for my personal use/education, and is not dedicated to any specific competition.

In addition, I have included practice drill problems and reference code for python and SQL from hackerrank.com and realpython.com. The spyder IDE included with Anaconda Navigator allows for the creation of code cells, which can be executed independently from the rest of the file.  Using these code cells, I can keep a very dense, searchable reference of the code snippets/algorithms/documentation in just a few files, as opposed to spread out across various markdown or .py files.  I included several versions of solutions for some problems, as nonoptimal solutions may fail for certain test cases due to exceeding time constraints of the problem.  The brute force approach may be the most intuitive, but there is often a 'trick' that will yield much better results when considering memory and timing constraints.
