## Reference Files for kaggle, hackerrank drills, and realpython.com lessons

This repo organizes code and notes from kaggle courses and competitions, serving mainly as a reference and not for a specific competition.

In addition, I have included practice drill problems and reference code for python and SQL from hackerrank.com and realpython.com. The spyder IDE included with Anaconda Navigator allows for the creation of code cells, which I can execute separately to test the code.  This way, I can keep a very dense reference of the code snippets/algorithms/documentation in a few files, as opposed to spread out across various markdown files or separate 
.py files.
